## How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your contributions! The goal is for this repo to be a reference source for the community on 0-days that are exploited in-the-wild. We'd love if others wrote root-cause-analyses, submitted modifications or new links, helped keep data up-to-date, etc! There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow if you'd like to contribute.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
