title: Root Cause Analyses

Beginning in 2019, Project Zero began a program to systematically study 0-day exploits that are used in the wild. It’s another way we’re trying to make 0-day hard. We published our [tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/) for recording publicly known cases of detected 0-day exploits. Today we’re beginning to share the root cause analyses we perform on these detected 0-day exploits. To better understand our approach and reasoning behind these analyses, please read [this blog post](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/07/root-cause-analyses-for-0-day-in-wild.html). 

We will continue to publish new root cause analyses as they are completed, hopefully in a very timely manner. We hope other researchers who detect and/or analyze 0-day exploits will also publish this information to better inform actions and decision making in the security and tech communities. The template that we use is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleprojectzero/0days-in-the-wild/main/0day-RCAs/template.md). We welcome pull requests!

Our goal is that this information helps the security and technical communities. Please [reach out](mailto:0day-in-the-wild@google.com) with any feedback or suggestions.
